# Vehicle Rental System - Database Design & SQL Queries

## 🚗 Overview
This project is a **Vehicle Rental System** database assignment designed to demonstrate knowledge of:
- Database table design  
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)  
- SQL queries using JOIN, EXISTS, WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING  

The system manages:
- **Users**  
- **Vehicles**  
- **Bookings**

## 🗂 Database Design & Business Logic

### Users Table
Stores user information:
- `user_id` (Primary Key)
- `name`  
- `email` (Unique)  
- `phone`  
- `role` (Admin / Customer)

### Vehicles Table
Stores vehicle information:
- `vehicle_id` (Primary Key)  
- `name`  
- `type` (car / bike / truck)  
- `model`  
- `registration_number` (Unique)  
- `rental_price`  
- `status` (available / rented / maintenance)

### Bookings Table
Stores booking information:
- `booking_id` (Primary Key)  
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users.user_id)  
- `vehicle_id` (Foreign Key → Vehicles.vehicle_id)  
- `start_date`  
- `end_date`  
- `status` (pending / confirmed / completed / cancelled)  
- `total_cost`

## 📝 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The ERD shows the relationships between tables:
- **One-to-Many:** Users → Bookings  
- **Many-to-One:** Bookings → Vehicles  
- **One-to-One (logical):** Each booking links one user to one vehicle  

**Note:** ERD submitted via Lucidchart (public shareable link included in submission).

## 🔍 SQL Queries

### Query 1: JOIN
Retrieve booking info along with customer name and vehicle name.
```sql
SELECT b.booking_id, u.name AS customer_name, v.name AS vehicle_name,
       b.start_date, b.end_date, b.status
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN vehicles v ON b.vehicle_id = v.vehicle_id;
```

### Query 2: NOT EXISTS

Find all vehicles that have never been booked.
```
SELECT *
FROM vehicles v
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM bookings b
    WHERE b.vehicle_id = v.vehicle_id
);
```

### Query 3: WHERE

Retrieve all available vehicles of type 'car'.
```
SELECT *
FROM vehicles
WHERE status = 'available'
  AND type = 'car';
```
### Query 4: GROUP BY & HAVING

Find vehicles with more than 2 bookings.
```
SELECT v.name AS vehicle_name, COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings
FROM vehicles v
JOIN bookings b ON v.vehicle_id = b.vehicle_id
GROUP BY v.name
HAVING COUNT(b.booking_id) > 2;
```
